# Simple Dotfiles

This repo should be my last temporary attempt at storing my dotfiles in one place before I get the time to fix my skill issues (lol)


I have yet to spend to the time to make a deploy-able dotfile script 
(where all dependancies are detected, installed, or have configurations changed accordingly).

Right now the process is just cloning this repo into the home directory and checking all the files manually-ish (very recently finally learend how to detect if commands exist on a system)

Currently the *dependancies* that this current configuration relise on is:

- [git](https://github.com/git/git) *if this isn't installed wtf*
- [fd or fdfind](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
    - [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) *needs to manually be cloned*
